This repository refers to the final project of USP Introduction to Data Science module (code: SCC0275).

We propose a context-sensitive approach to dealing with a recommendation problem using the League of Legends game as a context in our application.
Several hot data science techniques and analysis are present in this paper, intending to evaluate our knowledge and capabilities.

The results and comments in the pdf are in Portuguese due to the evaluative quality required.
